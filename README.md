#  Computational Analysis of Magnetic Topology in a Helical Stellarator
## Abstract


## Theory
Magnetic fields can be genearted by the flow of charges. One can determine the magnetic field generated by a constant current using the Biot-Savart Law:

$${B(r)} = \frac{\mu_{0}I}{4\pi}\int{\frac{\text{d}l\times {r'}}{|{r'}|^3}}$$

Where $dl$ is an infinitessimal segment of the path the current takes, and $r'$ is the full displacement vector from the wire element and the point at which the field is being calculated. $\mu_{0}$ is the permeability of free space and $I$ is the current.

Stellators are devices that confine plamsa through the use of magnetic fields, whose interactions are governed by the Lorentz Force. Many designs exist with varying levels of effectiveness. One such design consists of double-helical coils wrapped around a torus, accompanied by a set of equidistant toroidal coils. All the coils have the same magnitude of current, with the direction flipped for one of the helical coils. 

In this simulation, the double-helical configuration was set up, and the Biot-Savart law was used in order to visualise the magnetic flux surfaces caused by the magnetic fields from the coils.

This equation can be discretised and calculated computationally by turning the integral into a sum:

$${B}(r) \approx \frac{\mu_{0}I}{4\pi}\sum^{N}_{i=1}{\frac{dl_{i}\times ({r}-{r'_{i}})}{|{r}-{r'_{i}}|^{3}}}$$
